    "### The Problem\n",
    "In this project we will try to analyse the concentration of Chinese restaurants in London as well as outside London locations like Cambridge and Oxford. Two popular cities known for having the best universities in the world. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project will enable us to use powerful data science tools to analyse and visualise areas where there is lower concentration of Chinese restaurants and will help an investor who wants to set up a Chinese restaurant in a good location.\n"

    "The data to be used in solving this problem, we will be using geopy to find the coordinates for each neighborhood. Foursquare API will be used then to collect information on the neighborhood venues. \n",
    "\n",
    "Geopy Nominatin will be used to obtain the geo coordinates of the cities London, Cambridge and Oxford.\n"

    "### Methodology\n",
    "\n",
    "The machine learning algorithm to be used to solve the problem is K-means clustering. This method will show the concentration of Chinese restaurants in London, Cambridge and Oxford, which will help the investor or entrepreneur make informed decisions. The Longitude and Latitude of the separate locations will be used as input parameters for the K-means clustering algorithm and this will also provide a visualisation of the findings."
